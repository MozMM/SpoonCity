An e-commerce site selling a variety of spoons with clever names.

This was built at Grace Hopper Academy, by team members:
Krystal Cheung, Taryn Miller, Claire Moore, and Marta Mozelle.

## Tech Stack
| React | Redux | Express | Sequelize | Node.js | Mocha |

## Things to Note:
- This was our first project in senior phase of Grace Hopper. We focused on structure more than styling. 
- The most unique aspect of this project is the SQL schema, which I had an active part in designing and writing. We created tables for products, users, and orders, and associated through-tables. 
- I also contributed to writing the RESTful routes using complex queries to access and edit our data.
